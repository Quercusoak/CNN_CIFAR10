# CNN_CIFAR10
Exercise in cnn hyperparameter tuning.
The notebook explores different CNN architectures, regularization techniques, and optimizers to build a model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
It aims to find the best model configuration that maximizes accuracy and minimizes overfitting.
